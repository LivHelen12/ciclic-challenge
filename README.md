# Ciclic Challenge
## Description
This project consists of making a simple application to calculate compound interest using the math.js api.

It's important to note that the interest rate is fixed and does not represent reality.

Status: DONE âœ…

## How it works
The project was developed using vite, React and axios for the requests. Also, I am saving the data in localstorage to use it in another page.

You can see the project running [here](https://ciclic-challenge.vercel.app/).
